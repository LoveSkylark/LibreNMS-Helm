# PHP config files may be copied int the /application/config to adjust the setup.
# 
# Most configuration should be done in the WEBgui or by using "lmns config:set". 
# But if you whant to lock in a configuration so no one can change it, 
# then create a .php file and copy it into the /application/config directory.
# 
# This mostly good for external authentication
